It involves controlling 4 mobile robots so that they cover the maximum area possible inside a polygon. You can find more info at [paign10.me](http://paign10.me/projects/2012-09-24-voronoi-diagrams.html).


Dependencies
============

The code relies on the following MATLAB libraries: [`polycenter`](http://www.biomecardio.com/matlab/polycenter.html), [`myaa`](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/20979-myaa-my-anti-alias-for-matlab), [`export_fig`](http://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23629-export-fig).


Execution
=========

To execute the code, download the required dependencies and drop everything inside the repo's root folder. Then, inside MATLAB, navigate to the repo's folder, and simply execute:
```
